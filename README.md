# Dotfiles for my current linux environment (Manjaro)

## Config

### Oh My ZSH

- Install starship from [here](https://starship.rs/)

### spotifyd

- You'll need to fill out the information in the spotifyd.conf file, it should work out of the box

Everything else should be just a drop in to their respective folders, if not let me know.
